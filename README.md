## **Project Title**  - EDA on Titanic Dataset using Python 

<dl>
  <dt>Project Overview</dt>
  <dd>This project aims to identify the major factors that determined survival rate of the passengers in Titanic on the basis of various features such as PassengerClass, Sex, Age, Embarked. The dataset available on Kaggle, and consists sample size of 891.</dd>

<br />
The data was cleaned and pre-processed to handle missing values and outliers. Univariate,  Bivariate and Multivariate analysis for categorical and numerical variables. For testing 5 hypothesis, checking the correlation, used heatmap
</dd>

  <dt>Visualizations</dt>
  <dd>Several interactive visualizations were created to explore the data and convey the results of the analysis, including scatter plots, histograms, and box plots. Appropriate vizualization through bar plots, pairplots. </dd>

  <dt>Challenges and Limitations</dt>
  <dd>One of the main challenges faced during the project was the presence of missing data and outliers. 
</dd>

  <dt>Conclusion</dt>
  <dd>The passenger's class and gender are the strongest predictors of survival rate on the Titanic. Women had a higher chance of surviving than men. Passengers with higher-class tickets were more likely to survive than those who were in third class. Age also played a factor for determining survival as younger passengers were more likely to survive.
